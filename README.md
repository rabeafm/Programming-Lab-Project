# Project in system programming lab - Assembler

In this project giving as part of academic course, i wish to imitate the work of a common computer program which is an assembler for Assembly language.
The program will presented with the following files:
1- Source files of the program (.c & .h).
2- Runtime file for Ubuntu (Compiled and linked).
3- Makefile (Compiled with gcc with the flags -Wall -ansi -pedantic, with no messages or warning from the compiler).
4- Runtime Examples:
  a- Input in Assembly, Output as a result of the using the assembler on the input files, showing use of the different orders and data structures.
  b- Input in Assembly Displaying various error types (with no output files) and screenshots showing the errors.

Important Notes:
1- Abstraction of data structures: splitting data structures access and implementation
2- Uses of good variable and function names
3- Good Documentation

The Assembler's Role is to create a file of machine code from a file written in assembly language. which is the first step in the program cycle towards 
getting the code which is ready to run on the computer's hardware. next stages are linkage and loading which are not part of this program.

This program is writing an assembler (program that translate to machine language), for a special assembly language defined for the project.
